Yo yo yo, I'm Aye7even and I am currently enrolled into college for computer science,
however I'm thinking of switching to machine learning. I've always had some kind of 
passion for computers but never knew what to dabble into. I also have an interest into
cyber security and malware analysis, but haven't had much time to look into it. Shoot me
any questions you may have!
